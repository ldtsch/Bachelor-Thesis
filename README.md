# Bachelor-Thesis

In the subfolder "AssemblyInstructionAnalyzer", the Python module and the used instruction set specifications are included. Also, the objdumps used for analysis in the thesis are contained in the objdump.zip file.

The program can be started with the command
"python -m assembly_instruction_analyzer -o {objdump file}".
The report will then be stored in a directory and can be analyzed by using common programs such as qtiPlot, GnuPlot or MS Excel.
